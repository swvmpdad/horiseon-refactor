## Refactoring of the Horiseon webpage for accessibility

The Horiseon webpage needed a refactoring of the code to increase accessibility and fix a few minor errors.<br>
The code has been edited with 'alt' tags for images, semantic tags, labeled with comments,<br> and slightly rearranged to make reading the code easier.
